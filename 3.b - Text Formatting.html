    <h1 style="color: #4CAF50;">Computer Related Topics</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Computers are an integral part of modern life, impacting various fields and industries. Below are some key topics related to computers.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50; margin-bottom: 10px;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Key Areas of AI:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <li><em>Machine Learning</em>: Algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.</li>
        <li><em>Natural Language Processing</em>: Techniques for understanding and generating human language.</li>
        <li><em>Computer Vision</em>: Enabling computers to interpret and process visual information from the world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50; margin-bottom: 10px;">Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Cybersecurity involves protecting computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.</p>
    <blockquote style="margin: 20px; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff; border-left: 5px solid #4CAF50; font-style: italic;">
        "Cybersecurity is much more than a matter of IT." - Stephane Nappo
    </blockquote>

    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50; margin-bottom: 10px;">Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote database and retrieve them on demand.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><b>Benefits of Cloud Computing:</b></p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <li><b>Cost Efficiency</b>: Reduces the cost of managing and maintaining IT systems.</li>
        <li><b>Scalability</b>: Easily scales up or down according to the needs of the business.</li>
        <li><b>Accessibility</b>: Allows data and applications to be accessible from any location with internet access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50; margin-bottom: 10px;">Programming Languages</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Programming languages are used to create software and applications. They are a fundamental tool for developers to communicate instructions to a computer. Some popular programming languages include:</p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <li><b>Python</b>: Known for its readability and versatility, widely used in web development, data analysis, AI, and scientific computing.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript</b>: Essential for web development, allowing interactive elements on websites.</li>
        <li><b>Java</b>: Used for building cross-platform applications, from web to mobile to enterprise software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50; margin-bottom: 10px;">Quantum Computing</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. This technology has the potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers.</p>
    <pre style="background-color: #333; color: #fff; padding: 10px; overflow-x: auto;">
        Quantum computing utilizes qubits instead of bits.
        Classical Bit: 0 or 1
        Quantum Qubit: 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition)
