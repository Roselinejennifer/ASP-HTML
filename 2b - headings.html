    <h1>The Wonders of Nature</h1>
    <p>Nature is a vast and beautiful entity, encompassing various ecosystems and species that are integral to the Earth's biodiversity.</p>

    
    <h2>Forests and Their Ecosystems</h2>
    <p>Forests cover about 31% of the world's land area and are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

    
    <h3>Rainforests</h3>
    <p>Rainforests are dense, warm, and wet forests that are found in tropical regions. They are known for their incredible biodiversity.</p>

    <h3>Boreal Forests</h3>
    <p>Boreal forests, also known as taiga, are found in the northern regions and are characterized by coniferous trees like pines and spruces.</p>

   
    <h2>Oceans and Marine Life</h2>
    <p>Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and are vital for supporting marine life and regulating the global climate.</p>

   
    <h3>Coral Reefs</h3>
    <p>Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. They are often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea".</p>

    <h3>Deep Sea Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>The deep sea is a mysterious and largely unexplored part of the ocean, home to unique creatures adapted to extreme conditions.</p>

   
    <h2>Mountains and Their Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>Mountains are significant landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, offering unique habitats for various species.</p>

    
    <h3>Alpine Flora and Fauna</h3>
    <p>The alpine zone, found at high altitudes, is characterized by cold climates and hosts specially adapted plants and animals.</p>

    <h3>Mountain Forests</h3>
    <p>Mountain forests, found at lower altitudes, are rich in biodiversity and play a crucial role in the water cycle and carbon storage.</p>
